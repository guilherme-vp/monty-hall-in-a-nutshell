# Monty Hall In A Nutshell

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project intent to do a simulation of the famous Math problem of Monty Hall.


## Production Application

You can check the deployed application in: https://monty-hall-in-a-nutshell.vercel.app.


## Where is the problem?

You can run the simulation of the game in the [website](https://monty-hall-in-a-nutshell.vercel.app) or by calling the function [Monty Hall](./src/montyHall.ts) once, which will return the result if the player won or not.

If you want to run the game several times and analyze the results losses/wins and win rates, you can run the [playground runner function](./src/playgroundRunner.ts).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies by running:
```bash
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server with:

```bash
